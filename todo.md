# things to do

- [x] API endpoints to replace the PG view I look at
- [ ] add start/end time to checkpoints (or alternatively, a total duration)
- [ ] support for uploading images to reference in scenes
- [ ] add a user auth scheme (basic username/password)
- [ ] switch to PDF model (Ray Tracing: The Rest of your Life)
